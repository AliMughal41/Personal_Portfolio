          <h3>My Experience</h3>
          <p>
            I bring a unique blend of technical expertise and creative
            problem-solving to every project. As a BS Information Technology
            graduate from University of the Punjab (CGPA: 3.08/4.00), I have
            successfully delivered numerous projects using the MERN stack and
            Flutter.
          </p>
          <p>
            My passion lies in creating seamless user experiences and robust
            applications that exceed client expectations. From developing
            full-featured job portals with real-time chat to building
            cloud-based hospital management systems, I stay updated with the
            latest industry trends to deliver modern, scalable solutions.
